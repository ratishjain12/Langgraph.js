# LangGraph.js

This repository demonstrates how to use LangGraph with MongoDB for building and managing AI agents and conversational applications using an agentic approach. It showcases the integration of language models, graph-based conversation management, and MongoDB for data persistence, enabling the creation of intelligent, autonomous agents in TypeScript and Express.js.

## Features

- Utilizes LangGraph for managing agentic conversational flows in TypeScript
- Integrates with MongoDB Atlas for storing and retrieving conversation data
- Implements a RESTful API using Express.js for chat interactions
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model and Anthropic's API for generating responses
